# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Localization
I utilized transfer learning with pretrained ResNet50 to predict whether a patient has cancer or not and ResUnet model to locate the tumor based scans or MRIs.
Here is a general outline of the steps involved in this project : 
Data pre-processing: Preprocess the medical images to prepare them for modeling. This includes normalizing pixel values. Then I Utilized Transfer learning  with a pretrained ResNet50 model to train a binary classifier that predicts whether a patient has cancer or not
and ResUnet model to train a segmentation model that can localize the tumor within the medical image And finally the evaluation of boths models
